==========
==TO DO:==
==========
-check if the widgets already exist and don't create them if they do
-get the collections working properly
(make sure it checks if it already exists)

-add the comp guides back

-maybe connect the camera lens and other settings to a custom property on the camera bone that way it can be animated on the rig instead of over 2 objects.

-add user preferences so the user can set their own naming convention (for collections and widgets)
