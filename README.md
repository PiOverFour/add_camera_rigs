==========
==TO DO:==
==========
-add the comp guides back (it is different in 2.8)

-maybe connect the camera lens and other settings to a custom property on the camera bone that way it can be animated on the rig instead of over 2 objects.

-maybe remove the blank drivers on the camera and just leave them locked
