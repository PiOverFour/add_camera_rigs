This is the camera rigs add-on that I wrote for blender 2.6x
It currently ships with blender

The version that ships with 2.8 has had a automated script from the Blender Foundation
that edits some of the code to be valid for some of the api changes
(eg layers are now collections etc)
However, there are quite a lot of broken features and bugs in that version


My aim is as follows:
-update the code to work fully with 2.8 (fix broken stuff)
-improve my coding skills and split the code into smaller files (make it cleaner and more logical)
-improve the functionality of the rigs (make it work better)
-improve the code (learn how to do things smarter)

So far I have fixed some of the broken features (collections still work weirdly)
And I have started to split the original script into logical parts.

It currently won't work as I have split the files and I don't really know how to
reconnect in to the __init__.py
(at least I think that is what I need to do??)

-------------------------
WHAT DO I NEED HELP WITH?
-------------------------
I'm trying to move from being a 'scripter' to a 'coder'.  So any advice on how to
structure the project and any advice on smarter ways to do things.
(I'm self taught so I'm sure I have a lot of rookie mistakes)

I am using git but I don't really know what I'm doing
I need some advice on how to use it for when I want to try to add a feature w/o
it breaking the working version.
Best practice advice, and also how to branch and merge (that type of stuff)
